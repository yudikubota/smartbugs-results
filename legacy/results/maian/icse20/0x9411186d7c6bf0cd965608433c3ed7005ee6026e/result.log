/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/eth_utils/formatting.py:20: DeprecationWarning: The `is_prefixed` function has been deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release of the eth-utils library. Now that eth-utils is compatible with Python3, we encourage developers to use stdlib functions where possible.

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/eth_utils/string.py:22: DeprecationWarning: The `force_obj_to_bytes` function has been deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release of the eth-utils library. UTF8 cannot encode some byte values in the 0-255 range which makes naive coersion between bytes and text representations impossible without explicitly declared encodings.
